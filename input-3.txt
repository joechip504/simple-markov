This test case is meant to represent a realistic paragraph one might need to parse
I am not using any punctuation because that is part of the assignment and instead using new line at the end of each sentence
The point of this text is only to be read by the computer
Unique follows the word preceding it and thus should be the only word that follows that word as the word which is followed is only used once
